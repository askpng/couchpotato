This is a work in progress. README is TBA.

## Installation

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:


```
# Deploy image and reboot
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/askpng/fried-couchpotato:latest --apply 

# Deploy signed image and reboot
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/askpng/fried-couchpotato:latest --apply

# Update and reboot
sudo bootc upgrade --apply
```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build.
